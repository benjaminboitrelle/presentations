            <aside class="notes">
              journey from physics to software development has been driven by a
              desire to use technology to solve real-world problems. From my
              Ph.D. research on particle tracking at DESY, to my work on X-ray
              detectors at SOLEIL, and more recently on software solutions for
              industry, I’ve developed a broad skill set in both the theoretical
              and practical aspects of software development
